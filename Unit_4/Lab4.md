# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab was to gain a better understanding of image files along with an initial glimpse into graphic design. Since images are becoming more and more importing it is good to know what the differences in the file types are. Finally, we will learn more about the operating system by diving into the Windows command prompt and learning some basic commands. 

# Graphics
## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
* The difference between raster and vector images is that a raster image is composed of pixels while a vector image uses paths. In researching this I found that that it is easier to understand this concept by observing the two, zoomed in, side by side.  
* A raster image would be better for images that have more curves and vector would be better for straight lines. So, for photos raster images would be better but for more basic images vector would be better overall.  

## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
* The use of a lossless or lossy image format matters since sometimes a developer has to preserve the quality of a image. If they use the wrong file format, they can potentially lose some quality. Care must be taken to ensure that the correct file format is used for all parts of the job. 

## File Formats
* For the three file types, gif is the only one that can support animations. However, it should not be used for photos.  A jpg and png will support more colors than a gif. You should use a jpg or png for picture formats however, jpg image quality will degrade over time while png will not. 
One interesting point is that png supports background transparency while jpgs do not. 

# Operating Systems
* Screenshots can be seen in the GitHub

## Logo
* Image can be found uploaded to GitHub
* My image design consisted of nineteen layers. I found that locker layers as I moved through the design was crucial to creating the diagram. The moon was created by copying the main circle and making it smaller so that it would cover some of the moon. 
* The file would open with Firefox on my computer and has a file size of 86.2 KB . If I had a program for editing images on my computer that potentially would be better suited for opening the file, but I have already used the change button on my computer to make these files open with Firefox

# Conclusion
* I have learned more about image files than I knew before. Additionally, I learned more about using the command prompt that was very useful. Overall, I enjoyed working on this lab and learned a lot.
