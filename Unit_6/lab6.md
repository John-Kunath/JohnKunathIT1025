# Executive Summary
In this week’s lab we are looking at the internet and the many protocols that make up ut as well as some very important parts of internet security. 
# Internet Architecture

## Internet Protocol
* An IP address is a label assigned to any device connected to a network that uses the internet. There are small differences between IPv4 and IPv6 such as the number and type of characters associated with it along with the structure of the address. 
* See attached image
* ICANN is the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers. They help contribute to the global internet by coordinating maintenance on several databases that many people use. 
## TCP/IP

#### Review the first article and answer these questions:
* TCP/IP (Transmission control protocol/ Internet Protocol) is a network protocol first developed by the department of defense to connect government computers and was later brought to the public and now helps connects many devices on the internet together. 
* TCP/IP works in the client server setup by having one side connect to the server to share data. The client needs to know the address of the server it wants to connect to as well as the port number. Once a connection has been established data can be sent each way. 

#### Review the second article and answer these questions:
Review the section of the article aligning the post office with protocol stacks.  
* Layers are important because you can change a layer without impacting the other layers. This helps during technology changes since you could completely change one layer and the others would not be impacted in the slightest. 
* The apps that run on the application layer are HTTP. FTP. POP3, SMTP, SNMP

# Internet Security
#### Watch the video and answer these questions:
* HTTP is the hypertext transfer protocol. It is used to distribute hypermedia information systems. It sends the request to the server in clear text. 
* Https encrypts the sent data sent with http. SSL is another method of securing your data by using certificates to ensure you are visiting the correct website.  

#### Review the following article: Securing Your Web Browser 
* It is important to secure your web browser due to the potential vulnerabilities associated with some website that you could interact with on the internet. 
* One of the risks that the page shows is the use of cookies to identify users of a website. The page shows how if a hacker was able to use a cookie they could potentially hack a website user
 
# Internet Programming

* Upload screenshots of your html, css and result

Answer these questions
* Tim Berners was the inventor of the worldwide web and created the world wide web consortium to act as the main standards organization for the internet. W3C helps update all the standards used for building the internet  

*	One standard that is important is web architecture. This standard ensure that the designations or URI’s and HTTP is correct and website still follow these guidelines. 
*	XML works with html to display the correct image for the webpage to present. 

# URLs and File Paths
* Match the following terms / definitions under the heading and explain how they are related by providing an example of all of the pieces of a URL: 
Terms: 
* scheme -- https
* domain -- www.amazon.com
* top level domain -- .edu
* default page -- no file path provided 
* parameters -- results of a search
* anchor -- specific location on a page


* The absolute file path is a complete path to a file on your computer while the relative path is just listing the destination. If I was building a website, I would use the relative path to connect everything since it looks easier to put together compared to the absolute path. 

* File compression is an important part of transferring files over the internet and not enough people do it. Seriously how on earth is it ok that video games are now 80gb or more. Regarding website when you have files that need to be transferred it is possible to compress them first, so they take up less space. The end user can then uncompressed them on their side. 

# Conclusion
It is very important to be secure while on the internet. With the increasing amount of sensitive data that is sent you should always be secure while on the internet.
