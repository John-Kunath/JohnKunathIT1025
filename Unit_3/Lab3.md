# Executive Summary
* This lab will go over the preliminary information on software, certifications and finally professional organizations. 
# Software 
* Application software is used by the user to accomplish a goal. This software is like word processing software such as Microsoft Word. Utility software programs allow you to modify your computer in some way. These include anti-Malware software such as MalWarebytes which is a program that targets malware. Finally, Operating system software is software that manages computer hardware and there are many different kinds such as Microsoft Windows, Apples MacOs, and the open source Linux. 
* Explain the purpose of ERP software and provide an example. ERP software is Enterprise Resource Planning software. This software is used to connect many applications in businesses and provide many back-end functions. An example of this kind of software is SYSPRO.
* Virtualization is the creation of virtual resources. There are many things that you can virtualize such as a server, desktop, or a operating system to name a few. It works to separate the physical hardware by using specialized programs to emulate the hardware. This means that a virtual machine can be transferred from one computer to the other. This is different from cloud computing because in that software is run from far away on another machine. 
# Virtualization
* Some problems are solved with virtualization such a demand for specific hardware like servers. A single machine can emulate several servers for an organization. 
* The hypervisor decouples the virtual machines from the host and allocates the computers resources to each of them as it sees fit. 
# Career Exploration
## Career Exploration

#### Tri-C College Central: 
* Register for a student account.
* Use one of the search options such as "Search - Intern Central," take a screenshot of the listings (include your name in the upper right-hand corner in your screenshot,)  name the file: CollegeCentral and upload to your lab folder. 

#### Bureau of Labor Statistics
* Go to: Bureau of Labor Statistics website and continue exploring careers in IT (or your area of interest.) You can search for "web developer" or "network" or "cyber" and see what jobs appear.
Report your findings including job title, salary and projected growth. You can upload a screenshot if you want.

## Industry Certification
* I found that the initial certification for a cisco engineer is the Cisco Certified Technician (CCT) cert and to get it would involve taking a required exam at a certain date. This may have been changed due to covid. 
* In the tri c certificate, some of them were for the cisco and they would be a great addition to my resume after graduation.
* In order to become co-op ready, you must be at a 2.75 or higher GPA, be currently enrolled at Tri C, and have competed 12 credit hours of college coursework with at least two courses related to your major field. The benefit of pursing a co-op or internship is the staggering amount you will learn while on the job. I learned more during my first term as a co-op than I did at almost all my classes. 
## Professional Membership
* Joining an organization like IEEE especially as a student is incredibly beneficial. Being able to talk to those in the industry is a great benefit and they usually have a discount for current students. While I was in college, I joined the AMEE and enjoyed the experience and would recommend anyone to join the profession society for their major. 
# Conclusion
This lab went over some of the basic parts of programming as well as going over some important parts of finding an internship in the future.
