# Executive Summary
this assignment was centered around parts of the computer and how they interact with each other. 
# Hardrive 
## Hard Drives and Memory
* The difference between latency and transfer rate in regard to  the performance of a hard drive is that latency refers to the amount of time it takes for the hard drive to find the material and the transfer rate is the speed at which the data is transferred to and from the disk media. 
* The difference between an SSD and a hard drive is in the way the data is stored. The traditional hard drive will use metal disks and the SSD will use flash memory storage.  
* Since while the computer is running it takes the executable file from the hard drive and loads it onto the ram of the computer. So, when you add more ram the computer has more room to load this data.
* The difference between 32-bit and 64-bit architecture is the processor architecture. A 64-bit processor can store 2^64 values and a 32-bit can store 2^32 in the register. One of the most important pieces of information is that the 32-bit system will be unable to use more than 4gb of ram.  
## ALU and Control Unit
* The control unit is the hardware the directly interacts with eh computer processor. It lets most functions know how to respond to instructions. The ALU on the other hand is the leader of all the logical and arithmetic operations 
## CPU, Input and Output
--
## Logic Gates and circuits
* A truth table is a device that shows the logic of true false statements. The NAND gate is a device that uses the not statement 
* A NAND gate is like a NOT gate since a NAND gate is a not gate followed by a AND gate. 
## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
* The purpose of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. It is always important to consider the ethics of technology especially how technology might be used and its impacts. 
# Data Representation
## Numeric Conversions
* The difference between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal numbers are first binary numbers are only made up of ones and zeros. Decimal numbers are the numbers we use every day. Finally, hexadecimal numbers are numbers that have a base sixteen. 
* Work found in folder 
* The color  #ab00ff would be problematic for some monitors. When creating a website you must consider websafe colors that all monitors can display.
